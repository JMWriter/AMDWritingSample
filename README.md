# A Guide To Tic-Tac-Toe
The purpose of this document is to describe the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Below there will be sections for rules, conditions to win Tic-Tac-Toe, and an image of a common Tic-Tac-Toe game.

<h2>Win Condition</h2>
<li>The Goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is for a player to get 3 of their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal in order to win, referred to as a "three-in-a-row."

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>

<li>Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played on a board of 9 squares arraged in a 3 by 3 formation by two players.</li>
<li>One player is represented by "X." The second player is designated as "O."</li> 
<li>The player designated "X" will always play the first move by placing their symbol within a square on the board, claiming that square. After a square has been claimed, no player may place another symbol on that square.</li>
<li>After "X" has made their move, "O" makes their move by placing their symbol on a square that is currently empty. This process repeats until all squares are filled or a player has fulfilled the win condition.</li>
<li>If no player has gotten three in a row and all squares are filled the game is considered a draw and another game may be played with the same rules above.</li>
<li>Optionally, players may choose to switch symbols before starting a new game. </li>
